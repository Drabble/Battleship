# Battleship

A multiplayer web based battleship game.

## Introduction

The official server for the game is reachable at (https://battleship-asad.herokuapp.com)[https://battleship-asad.herokuapp.com].

A game takes place the following way:

* One or more players join the game by connecting on the server.
* The game starts and 5 ships of sizes 2,3,3,4,5 are randomly places on the 10x10 board.
* The players use the left mouse button to click shoot at the cells on the board.
* When a cell is shot, it becomes blue if no boat was hit, it becomes red if a boat was hit and green if the entire boat was sunk.
* When a boat is sunk, the player that shot it last winw a number of points equal to the length of the sunk bot.
* When the last boat is sunk, the player that has the most points wins.
* A messsage is shown to all the players with the end game message and the game restarts after 10 seconds.
